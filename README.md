# Artificial intelligence

Artificial intelligence (AI) refers to the simulation of human intelligence in machines that are programmed to think like humans and mimic their actions.

The term may also be applied to any machine that exhibits traits associated with a human mind such as learning and problem-solving.

# Machine learning

Machine Learning is the field of study that gives computers the capability to learn without being explicitly programmed.

# Deep learning

Deep learning is an AI function that mimics the workings of the human brain in processing data for use in detecting objects, recognizing speech, translating languages, and making decisions. 

Deep learning AI is able to learn without human supervision, drawing from data that is both unstructured and unlabeled.
